# The Knapsack Game


Fill your knapsack!

This game is based off of the famous Knapsack problem, where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and have to determine the number of items to include in your knapsack so that the weight doesn't exceed a limit and you make the most profit.

In this version, you and 9 other AI miners are tasked with going out into caves and mining different gems to sell. However, all of them won't fit in your knapsack, which will carry the gems, so you must find the best combination that allows for the most profit. Beware, because the shop only gives money to the miners with the highest profit, and as each day goes by the other miners get better at finding the best combinations. Lastly, you lose health everyday and can only be replenished with food and bandages.

I made this during the summer in between my Freshman and Sophomore year of high school (Summer 2018).


## BASIC GAMEFLOW


Each day follows a pattern of mining, deciding your knapsack, and finding out if you make money at the end of the day. However, there are twists and turns when you least expect it...


## SIMPLIFIED INTERFACE


The graphics for the game provide a pixelated yet interesting view for your eyes, with specially designed characters and gems.


## DIFFICULT CHALLENGE


Note that this game isn't going to be easy, and will provide a stimulating experience as you race to beat the other miners and survive.
